        I am a postdoctoral researcher with a background in experimental psychology, cognitive neuroscience and philosophy. Currently, I work in the  <a href="https://nin.nl/research/researchgroups/van-someren-group/">Sleep & Cognition Group</a> led by Eus van Someren at the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience. 
        My current work focuses on the interplay of insomnia, anxiety and hyperarousal. Hyperarousal is intricately related to poor sleep - tension and worry prior to bedtime prevent us from getting a good night's rest. 
            At the same time, sound sleep is vital for the processing of our worries overnight. As part of my postdoc, I am thinking about the directionality of this relationship. How exactly does daytime anxiety carry into sleepless nights? And which biological mechanisms can explain why restless sleep perpetuates anxious feelings overnight?

        Previously, I worked on how the brain processes information during sleep at the <a href="http://www.ccc-lab.org/">University of Cambridge</a>  and investigated prediction errors in schizophrenia at the <a href="https://www.umcutrecht.nl/en/research/researchers/neggers-sfw">UMC Utrecht</a>. During my PhD at the <a href="https://www.psychologie.uni-wuerzburg.de/en/expklin/home/">University of Würzburg</a>, I focused on the behavioural and neural mechanisms underlying attentional shifts to humans in our environment.        </p>
